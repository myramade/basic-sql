#SQL Tutorial

This is an introduction to basic SQL to help business professionals up and running writing SQL database queries.  I'll cover topics at a high-level and share some base terminology you should familiarize yourself with.  

For this tutorial we will be using MySQl Workbench which you can download and install from the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).  Follow the instructions on the website for your specific operating systems whether it's Windows or Mac. 

The units in this tutorial are:

:octocat: What is a database

:octocat: How a database stores data

:octocat: Entity Relationship Design (ERD)

:octocat: Intro to Structure Query Langugage (SQL)

:octocat: SQL Syntax

:octocat: Querying & Filtering Data

Remember, this is an introdcution to basic SQL and not a full course on SQL. I will NOT cover how to create, modify, or delete a database.
